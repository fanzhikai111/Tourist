# JPetStore Instrumented with ExplorViz Monitoring

This is an example of how we instrument a web application. All credits for JPetStore go out to https://github.com/mybatis/jpetstore-6

To successfully run it, you still need a Tomcat or Jetty which must be configured to use the WEB-INF/lib/explorviz-monitoring.jar  as a javaagent on startup.
